# ActivityLearning

The application is about detecting and predicting human activity. Thus the application
should be able to detect the movements that a person is making and based on that it
should predict what activity the person is doing. These activities would be walking,
running, walking up and down stairs, standing, sitting and bicycling.
The functional requirements set for the challenge are:
- Detecting the human movements
- Classifying the read sensor information
- Predicting correctly what the human activity is
- Visualizing and communicating the predictions to the users
Reliability of the prediction is important to provide usable information to the user.
Reliability of the prediction is dependent on the accuracy of the data provided from
the sensors and accuracy of the models used.
Accuracy of the trained data is the start point for an accurate and reliable prediction.
For this challenge, data collection for 7 activities of 10 males is provided by the
university. We are not accurately predicting the output every single time, especially
while biking - where the app confuses the activity for jogging in many instances.
Time
It was important to us to keep the loading time small, the delay between the action
and the activity prediction also small. Sometimes the app takes longer to predict the
activity and falls behind the real time, but it depends from instance to instance.
